        <h2>Introducing: Breads of the World!</h2>
        <p>It seems as though every region of the world has its own special take on this staple of humankind. From crusty french baguettes to table-sized Afghan flat-breads, breads can come in all shapes, sizes, and textures.</p>
        <p>Each month, we feature a bread that is the specialty of a particular culture or part of the world. Some will be made in-house by our bakers who travel around the world learning regional techniques in order to bring them back for you to try. Other breads will be provided by local bakeries that have been making bread for their communities for generations.</p>

        <p>When you are in the bakery, we encourage you to give our featured Bread of the World a try. If you can't make it to the shop, many of our breads will be available for purchase online.</p>
        <p>Providing you with fresh, unique breads is one of the things that makes Black Goose Bakery proud.</p>
